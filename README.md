## Project Description

This project is a social platform which people can track and trade indices, bonds, ETFs, funds, commodities, cryptocurrencies and stocks. It also gives people chance to share their ideas about investments, events and not only commenting but also rating predictions of other users. In addition, users can follow other users, make investments and predictions, search events that may have impact on prices and calculate profit/loss. The system also makes predictions and suggestions to users according to their historical data.
